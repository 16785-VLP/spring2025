Guillermo del Toroâ€™s **Pinocchio (2022)**, an Oscar nominated stop motion animation movie, took 15 years 
to make with a budget estimated over 35 million dollars. Another celebrated motion picture, 
**Loving Vincent (2017)**, was fully hand painted by 152 artists and its production took 7 years, costing 5.5 
million dollars.

**This semester we will develop and experiment with ideas to make such type of films using AI and robotics technologies.**

Course topics include language models, vision-language models, planning, and robot learning. Examples 
of class projects include painted movies (robot painting), stop motion movies (manipulation), animation 
(text to image/video generation), directing (direction following), and robotic cinematography.  

The final projects will be premiered at the end of the semester.

**Additional project details to be released soon!**
