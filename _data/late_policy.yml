policies:
  - Each student will have up to 5 days of grace that can be used for any homework in whatever way 
    without a penalty. For example, you can use all of the 5 days for the first homework assignment, or split 
    into 2 and 3 days to use for the first and the second assignments, respectively. After the 5 grace 
    days have been used up, there will be no additional extensions; 50% will be deducted 1 day after 
    a due date, and no points will be given after 2 days.
  - There <b>won't</b> be any extensions for final project presentation and report.
