course_name: "16-785 Integrated Intelligence in Robotics: Vision-and-Language Planning"

course_topic_title: "Filmmaking using AI & Robotics"

course_topic: "<p>Guillermo del Toro’s <i>Pinocchio (2022)</i>, an Oscar nominated stop motion animation movie, 
took 15 years to make with a budget estimated over 35 million dollars. Another celebrated motion picture, 
<i>Loving Vincent (2017)</i>, was fully hand painted by 152 artists and its production took 7 years, costing 5.5 
million dollars. In this class, we will develop and experiment ideas to make such films using AI and 
robotics technologies. Course topics include <b>language models, vision-language models, planning, and 
learning in the context of robotics</b>.</p> <p>Examples of class projects include painted movies (robot painting), 
stop motion movies (manipulation), animation (text to image/video generation), directing (direction following),
and robotic cinematography.  The final projects will be premiered at the end of the semester. </p> "

course_description: "<p>This is a project-oriented seminar course that covers interdisciplinary topics 
on cognitive intelligence in robotic systems. Cognitive abilities constitute high-level, humanlike 
intelligence that exhibits reasoning or problem-solving skills. Such abilities as semantic perception,
use of language, and task planning can be built on top of low-level robot autonomy. The topics covered 
generally bridge across multiple technical areas, for example, vision-language intersection and 
language-action/plan grounding.</p> <p><b>The project theme in Spring 2025 is filmmaking</b> that presents 
various robotics and machine learning challenges ranging from content generation such as scenario 
generation or scene/video synthesis/editing to robotics automation such as autonomous camera control 
or autonomous stop-motion control. The class will study both recent and seminal works in the field 
of intelligent robotics. The learning objectives of class projects will also put a special emphasis 
on research skills, e.g., problem formulation, literature review, ideation, evaluation planning, 
results analysis, and hypothesis verification. <u>The course is discussion intensive, and thus attendance 
is required.</u></p>"

course_prereq: "There are no explicit prerequisites for this class, but a general background knowledge 
in AI and machine learning is assumed."

course_goals:
    header: "In this course, we will strive to answer the following research questions and beyond 
    towards the goal of developing cognitive capabilities on robots."
    goals:
        - goal: "How can we make robots to perform tasks following natural language instructions?"
        - goal: "How can we develop robots that can describe in natural language what they perceive 
        through vision or explain what they are doing and why?"
        - goal: "How can we fuse information coming in multiple modalities, e.g., language and images, 
        to understand context-aware, semantic meanings of sensory data?"
        - goal: "How do we measure the quality of information translated between different modalities, 
        e.g., how do we measure the quality of language description given an image? What are the 
        limitations and shortcomings of existing metrics?"
        - goal: "How can we make use of semantic information digested from raw sensory inputs in the 
        process of planning to solve a problem/task?"
        - goal: "How do we measure the performance of computer vision algorithms outside benchmark 
        datasets, e.g., on robots?"
        - goal: "How should learned knowledge be stored? Do we need a universal representation for 
        knowledge?"
        - goal: "How can we make robots learn to improve over time, e.g., by learning new skills?"
    footer: "Using these research questions, we will learn to follow basic steps of conducting research 
    through class projects."
